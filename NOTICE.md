# NOTICE

## About This Project

**Trail Mate Center** is the desktop control center for Trail Mate / Meshtastic devices.
It connects over USB HostLink and provides monitoring, messaging, telemetry visibility, and protocol inspection.

This repository contains **host-side software only**. Device firmware is maintained in separate projects.

This is an actively developed engineering project, not an abandoned code drop and not a code archive.

If you are evaluating, integrating, porting, modifying, or using this codebase in any product, research, deployment, or internal tooling — you are encouraged to contact the author.
